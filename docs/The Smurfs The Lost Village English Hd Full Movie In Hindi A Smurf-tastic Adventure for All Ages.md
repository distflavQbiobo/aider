The Smurfs The Lost Village is a reboot of the previous live-action/animated hybrid films and the third installment in Sony's Smurfs film series. The film was directed by Kelly Asbury and written by Stacey Harman and Pamela Ribon, based on the Smurfs comic series by Peyo[^1^]. The film was dedicated to Jonathan Winters, Anton Yelchin, and Nine Culliford, who died before the film's release[^1^].
 
The plot of The Smurfs The Lost Village follows Smurfette and her friends as they discover a map that leads them to a hidden village of Smurfs in the Forbidden Forest. There, they meet a tribe of female Smurfs led by Smurfwillow, who reveal that they are the descendants of the original Smurfs who fled from Gargamel's ancestors. Smurfette also learns that she has a special connection to the village, as she was created from a fragment of the Smurf essence that Gargamel stole from the forest[^2^] [^3^].
 
However, Gargamel soon tracks down the Smurfs and invades the village with his army of vultures and cat robots. He captures all the Smurfs except for Smurfette, who sacrifices herself to destroy his machine and free her friends. The Smurfs mourn for Smurfette, who turns into a lifeless lump of clay. However, their tears of love revive her and turn her into a true blue Smurf. The two villages celebrate their reunion and welcome Smurfette as one of their own[^2^] [^3^].
